Assignment: Milestone 1. Lexical Analysis

So far, I have created a lexer which successfully removes white space and comments from the input file 
and correctly extracts all the tokens of the source code. It does not crash or become unstable if the 
source file contains any kind of lexical errors. 

The lexer has been tested using the provided JACK source files and is shown to function 
properly without any issues.
